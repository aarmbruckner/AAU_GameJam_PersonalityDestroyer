== Pulishing a Unity Game ==

To publish a Unity game at itch.io follow these steps:

1. open the game project in unity
2. select file -> BuildSettings
3. Select WebGL
3a. Unity might request a download of the WebGL-Support 
4. Click "PlayerSettings" and then select "Minimal" on the right side of the screen
5. On the left side click either "Build" or "Build And Run"
5a. When doing this the first time, Unity ask for a folder to export your game to
6. In this folder patch the file "index.html" (see below)
7. Zip the folder
8. Upload at itch.io and enjoy

=== Patching index.html ===

index.html needs to ne patched right after the <head> tag with the following lines:

<style>
html, body {
    border: 0px;
    margin: 0px;
    padding: 0px;
}
</style>

This avoids the 8 pixel border that would otherwise show up on the itch.io page.
